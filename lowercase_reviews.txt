i have bought several of the vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality the product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better my labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most
product arrived labeled as jumbo salted peanutsthe peanuts were actually small sized unsalted not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as jumbo
 and the wardrobe  this is the treat that seduces edmund into selling out his brother and sisters to the witch
if you are looking for the secret ingredient in robitussin i believe i have found it  i got this in addition to the root beer extract i ordered which was good and made some cherry soda  the flavor is very medicinal
 this is a deal
 this lasted only two weeks i would recommend this brand of taffy  it was a delightful treat
 fralingers  would highly recommend this candy  i served it at a beachthemed party and everyone loved it
this taffy is so good  it is very soft and chewy  the flavors are amazing  i would definitely recommend you buying it  very satisfying
right now im mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass they love it i rotate it around with wheatgrass and rye too
this is a very healthy dog food good for their digestion also good for small puppies my dog eats her required amount at every feeding
 incredible service
 no byproduct food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump  the higher food sits going stale  they both really go for this food  and my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week
 i now need to find a new food that my cats will eat
good flavor these came securely packed they were fresh and delicious i love these twizzlers
the strawberry twizzlers are my guilty pleasure  yummy six pounds will be around for a while with my son and i
my daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot its exactly what you would expectsix packages of strawberry twizzlers
i love eating them and they are good for watching tv and looking at movies it is not too sweet i like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so i can take my time eating them
i am very satisfied with my twizzler purchase  i shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them  i will definitely be ordering more
  this product is kosher thank you
candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price  i was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me
 packed well and arrive in a timely manner
 ounce bags pack of a
i can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasnt dropped in all these years still a superb product you wont be disappointed with
i love this candy  after weight watchers i had to cut back but still have a craving for it
 more often than im able to buy them right now
 ounce bags pack of a
 no flavor  just  plan and chewy   i would never buy them again
i was so glad amazon carried these batteries  i have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size  i need them for my garage door openerbr great deal for the price
 you would never guess that theyre sugarfree and its so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free  i was so impressed that ive ordered some for myself w dark chocolate to take to the office so ill eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweetsbr these are just excellent
 incredible service
 too as a usually noncoffee drinkerbr the little dolche guesto machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good coffeelattecappuccinoetc in less than a minute if water is heated up i would recommend the dolce gusto to anyone too good for the price and iam getting one myself 
 thanks amazon for selling this productbr br staral
 the instant mccanns becomes too thick and gluey
 but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you  great on a cold morning when you dont have time to make mccanns steel cut oats  the apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too  plus they dont require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart
 count boxes pack of 
 with fiber but wont make you bloat
br abby
 convenient
 so i ended up trying the apple and cinn  found it to be very tastefull when made with water or powdered milk  it goes good with oj and coffee and a slice of toast and your ready to take on the worldor the day at least  jerry reith
 count boxes pack of a
 and extremely cheap
 love oatmeal
i have mccanns oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from amazon i am able to save almost  per boxbr it is a great product tastes great and very healthy
 this is excellent
we really like the mccanns steel cut oats but find we dont cook it up too oftenbr this tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenientbr anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing
 so i probably wont buy it again
good oatmeal  i like the apple cinnamon the best  though i wouldnt follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste  that could just be me since i like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of
 i do not see any differce between this and oaker oats brand  they are both mushy
 but not the variety ill get all maple and brown sugar
this is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores  there is nothing healthy about it  it is just carbs and sugars  save your money and get something that at least has some taste
 i dont like it quaker oats is the way to go
  but not burn your mouth forever hot  its a nice temp  perfect for us
